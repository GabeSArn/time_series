<h3> Understanding Our Data </h3>
===================

<p> Our dataset was collected from [JHU GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data). It contains up to date information regarding the latest COVID-19 counts. Data includes international locations, as well as updated data from the United States.
</p>


<p>Since the beginnning of the year COVID-19 has spread across America. The first case in the United States was recorded in January 2020. As of July 30, millions have been infected. And over 150000 people have died from the virus.</p>

<p>
Our goal was to build a model to project death rates for cities in America.
</p>


<h3>Models Used</h3>
==============

<p> We used different types of ARIMA models to predict the number of cases. They included: </p>

<ul><li>ARMA</li>
    <li>ARIMA</li>
    <li>SARIMAX</li>
</ul>

<p> The model we chose was: </p>


<h3>Results and Recommendations</h3>
<p>We are seeing that highly populated areas were hit extremely hard. We believe that it is a result of the dense population and high transmission rate. </p>

<p>What we have also noticed is small, less densely populated cities, that had shorter lockdown periods are now experiencing high rates of contact.</p>
